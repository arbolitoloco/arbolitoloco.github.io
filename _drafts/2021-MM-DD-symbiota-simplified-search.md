I designed and developed this.
NEON Biorepository Data Portal contains a customized Symbiota search form that was simplified.

From two step process to one page
Validation
Filtering by NEON Domain and Site
Multi-filtering by different categories
Criteria chips
Accordions
Sass
JavaScript
jQuery
Customized PHP API to output information
Customized DB fields for collection information

Being ported to Symbiota-Light
