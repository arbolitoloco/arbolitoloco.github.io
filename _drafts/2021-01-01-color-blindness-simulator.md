I was designing a diagram for a scientific paper that was using many different colors to designate separate concepts. I wanted to make sure that the final image I produced was accessible to all kinds of visions, including to those with varied levels of color blindness.

I quickly discovered that there was no quick and free way to test images for their accessibility, so I decided to create my own tool. [In the Color Blindness Simulator website](https://laura.rochaprado.com/color-blind-simulator/) you can upload an image and quickly visualize and download simulations for different kinds of color blindness.

In 2020 I pushed the first version that I then offered in Hacktoberfest for programmers new to open source to help. In total, 11 contributors showed up and helped me improve styles, add content and translate the website into different languages.
