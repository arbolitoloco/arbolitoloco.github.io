I'm a documentation freak - I take notes about everything I do and I record protocols and solutions as best as I can, in hopes that my notes can help me or others when issues arise.

I proposed the creation of the [Symbiota Docs](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/) website, as a way to centralize and publish Symbiota software documents to the community. This project has finally been picked up by the [Symbiota Support Hub](https://symbiota.org/) and has been launched in October 2021.

I've set it up as a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/BioKIC/symbiota-docs/) that is compiled automatically to a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)-based [user-friendly interface](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/). Contributors and Editors add Markdown files to structured topic directories, and the website is then compiled into HTML whenever a new GitHub update has been pushed.

The documentation is being translated into Spanish and French, and a language toggle option is available in the website.

The website is open-source and contributions of all sorts are welcome. Users can create a fork of the GitHub repository directly from the page they want to edit by clicking the "Edit This Content On GitHub" button. Each page also has a "citation" blurb, to help give credit to everyone involved in editing, reviewing or translating the content.
