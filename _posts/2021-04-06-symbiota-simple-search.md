The standard Symbiota search form is a bit too complex for some users, especially for those who are not familiar with the portal. It features a two-step search form, with a first step to select the collection(s) and a second step to select the search fields.

For the [NEON Biorepository Data Portal](https://biorepo.neonscience.org/), I designed and developed a [simplified and modernized version of the search form](https://biorepo.neonscience.org/portal/neon/search/index.php). It is a single-step search form, that separates search fields (criteria) in collapsible accordions, for a better user experience.

Another user experience improvement is the addition of dynamic search chips, which display in a side panel a summary of the criteria entered by the user. The chips can be removed by the user, and the search will be updated accordingly.

Finally, the search form also includes help information for every entry field, and customized filters for the collection and locality selection, which are of extreme importance for the type of data published in the NEON Biorepository Data Portal.

To check the simplified search form in action, visit the [NEON Biorepository Data Portal](https://biorepo.neonscience.org/portal/neon/search/index.php). To see what the standard Symbiota search form looks like, visit the [SEINet website](https://swbiodiversity.org/seinet/collections/index.php).

This simplified search form is only available for the NEON Biorepository Data Portal. If you'd like to have it in your Symbiota portal, please contact me.
