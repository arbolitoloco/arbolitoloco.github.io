# Hi! I'm Laura

I am a leaf beetle taxonomist who loves to code. I am currently working as Biodiversity Bioinformatician at the Arizona State University, in Tempe, AZ, US. My responsabilities include developing and managing different Symbiota portals from many scientific disciplines, creating and developing tools to aid scientific research, and managing/cleaning/manipulating Biodiversity Data.

I've always been passionate about programming, having written my first lines of code as a child. Since joining grad school (2008), I started programming to solve problems that I faced while doing research. A few years ago, I began freelancing as a front end web developer, as a side job, coding everything from responsive newsletters, to one-page websites and custom Wordpress themes for e-commerces.

I like to imagine and make things, and that is also reflected in my hobbies, which include arts & crafts. After graduating, I founded a small brand of handcrafted items called [Fina Paca](http://finapaca.com/), which I now keep as a blog just to showcase my crafts.

I love the interface between science, creativity, and technology, and I'm hoping I can build a career in that multidisciplinary area. I support open science, and I try to encourage the use of technology tools in Taxonomy. I am also active in promoting science communication, and offer support to fellow women scientists in Brazil, through a community-driven website that I developed and manage (with the help of a team of editors) called [Mulheres na CiÃªncia](http://mulheresnaciencia.com.br/).
