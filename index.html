          <p>I'm an entomologist, based in São Paulo, Brazil, specialized in the evolution and classification of neotropical leaf beetles.
          On my current full-time job, I'm responsible for supervising and training new contractors that do data-entry in a <a href="http://bit.do/sibbr">biodiversity database</a>, which gathers information about insects from a Natural History Museum.</p>
          <p>I've always been passionate about programming, having written my first lines of code as a child. Since grad school, I started programming to solve problems that I faced while doing research. Last year I began freelancing as a <a href="http://laurarprado.com">front end web developer</a>, as a side job, coding everything from responsive newsletters, to one-page websites and custom Wordpress themes for e-commerces.</p>
          <p>I like to imagine and make things, and that is also reflected in my hobbies, which include arts &amp; crafts. After graduating, I founded a small brand of handcrafted items called <a href="http://finapaca.com.br">Fina Paca</a>.</p>
          <p>I love the interface between science, creativity, and technology, and I'm hoping I can find a career in that multidisciplinary area. I support open science, and I try to encourage the use of technology tools in Taxonomy. I am also active in promoting science communication, and offer support to fellow women scientists in Brazil, through a community-driven website that I developed and manage (with the help of a team of editors) called <a href="http://mulheresnaciencia.com.br">Mulheres na Ciência</a>.</p>

          <p>I am a leaf beetle taxonomist who loves to code. I am currently working in Biodiversity Bioinformatics as an Information Specialist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, building a Symbiota portal that will bring together specimens belonging to five different natural history museums on campus, housed in the collections of the departments of anthropology, botany, entomology, geoscience, and zoology.</p>
