	<a href="https://github.com/arbolitoloco/jantar-das-minas">Github repository</a>
	<p>Tool created with Google Docs (Forms, Spreadsheet and mail merging) and Google Apps Script in order to easily split dinner costs between my friends and I. People insert costs easily in a Spreadsheet by filling a Form, which triggers functions that split costs between participants, and sends emails to people letting them know what they should pay or receive.
